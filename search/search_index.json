Wishing to improve your productivity you start looking for a CLI tool. This page is an overview of several CLI tools to manage issues in JIRA that I had a chance to review. This page was only written after I spent time to write my own rudimentary tool in Python and to use it for a while, \u2014 only to find out later that there are a few much more mature tools which I should have been using instead in the first place. That's the importance of doing proper research: that might save you a lot of effort and precious time. Better later then never, right?
