Under **graph visualization**, we mean a visual user interface where a person can browse the graph using their mouse and keyboard, navigating through the graph's nodes and edges.

In this comparison, we illustrate whether particular graph database supports a built-in UI of this kind, and provide a proof link if we have it.
