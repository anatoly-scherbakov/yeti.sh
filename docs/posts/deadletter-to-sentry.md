title: Deadletter queue to Sentry
---

When an AWS Î» function tied to SQS queue fails multiple times, after certain number of retries the message which fails the queue is sent to deadletter queue. Let's alert Sentry if that happens.

```terraform
locals {
  sentry_dsn = "https://..."
}


module sqs_to_trigger_lambda {
  source  = "Recall-Masters/sqs-lambda-trigger/aws"
  version = "0.0.5"

  aws_sqs_queue_name = "${local.application_name}-badaboom"

  aws_lambda_function_name          = aws_lambda_function.badaboom.function_name
  aws_lambda_function_iam_role_name = aws_iam_role.badaboom.name

  batch_size                         = 1
  maximum_batching_window_in_seconds = 10

  alarm_actions = [module.dead_letter_notification.sns_topic.id]
}


module dead_letter_notification {
  source  = "Recall-Masters/sns-to-sentry/aws"
  version = "0.0.4"

  name        = "${local.application_name}-deadletter-notification"
  sentry_dsn  = local.sentry_dsn
  message     = "Nothing worked and we now have something in deadletter queue! AAAA!!!"
  environment = var.environment
}
```
