title: ðŸ’¡ Ideas
---

In this section of the site, I publish ideas for projects I haven't got time or energy to even start.

These pages are intended to:

* structure my thoughts on these subjects,
* get these thoughts out of my system, free my mind to think about the issues at hand rather than distracting to something new that tries to grasp my imagination,
* and perhaps provide groundwork to start those projects someday in the future â€” maybe to myself or to someone else.

Consider this section of the site a shameless collection of quick and dirty drafts.
