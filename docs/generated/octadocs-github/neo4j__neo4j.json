One query to benefit would be `MATCH (a)-[*4..5]->(b) RETURN DISTINCT a, b`. [\\#9062](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9062)\r\n- Allow more granular configuration of literals extraction [\\#9093](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9093)\r\n- It is no longer possible to CREATE or DROP composite uniqueness constraints. To enforce composite uniqueness, we refer to the new NODE KEY constraint. [\\#9135](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9135)\r\n- Use getDegree instead of expansion [\\#9139](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9139)\r\n- Correct query type for procedures [\\#9143](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9143)\r\n- Handle Ands with single value [\\#9149](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9149)\r\n- Predicates on shortest path and optional match [\\#9156](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9156)\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\n\r\n- Removed `neo4j-shared.sh`. Functionality is now included in all wrapper scripts directly [\\#9083](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9083)\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n\r\n- Added new role `Editor` that is allowed to read and write data but not allowed to create new tokens. [\\#9081](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9081)\r\n\r\n### Causal Clustering\r\n\r\n- Improve transaction streaming [\\#9070](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9070)\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\n- Added `--version` argument to `neo4j-admin` and `neo4j` commands [\\#9102](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9102)\r\n- Renamed `neo4j-admin version` to `neo4j-admin store-info` [\\#9126](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9126)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- Show allocated memory and page hits/faults in `dbms.listQueries` [\\#9037](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9037)\r\n- Neo4j now exits with code 0 for SIGINT and SIGTERM [\\#9108](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9108)\r\n\r\n    \r\n    - systemd will no longer report neo4j as `failed` after you do `systemctl stop neo4j`.\r\n    - Hitting Ctrl-C when running `neo4j console` will no longer exit with error if shutdown was performed gracefully.\r\n"

Use of a release candidate implies acceptance of the UXIP terms, which include allowing passive reporting about usage. Of course, we would also love to hear active feedback about your experience.\n\nAs beta software, release candidates are not appropriate for production use. There is no supported upgrade path, and while the features and APIs have been finalized, changes may still occur to correct errors (hopefully reflecting your feedback).\n\n## Download\n\nYou can [download Neo4j 3.0-RC1](http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases) or use one of the other distribution mechanism (debian package, homebrew etc). Please check out our [Blog post](http://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-3-0-release-candidate-1/) with more details and also links to the most recent binary protocol drivers.\n\n## Feedback, please!\n\nUse this release candidate to help us test Neo4j thoroughly so that we can provide an amazing and stable release. We\u2019d love to hear from you on our [public Slack](http://neo4j.com/slack) or via e-mail: feedback@neo4j.com.\n"

New option `--ignore-extra-columns` to log those into the \"bad\" file\n- When stopping Neo4j, the timeout will no longer forcefully shut down the process (which would require recovery on next start). Instead, a warning is displayed and waiting will continue.\n- Within a cluster, slaves which fail to apply updates will kernel panic to prevent further updates attempts, which could cause other harm. Failure to apply a transaction may be caused by severe underlying problems, for example out of disk space.\n\nFor the complete list of all changes, please see <a href=\"https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/wiki/Neo4j-2.2-Enterprise-changelog\">the changelog</a>.\n\n**All Neo4j users are recommended to upgrade to this release**. <a href=\"http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.7/deployment-upgrading/\">Upgrading to Neo4j 2.2 (from Neo4j 2.1 or earlier) requires a migration to the on-disk store</a> and can not be reversed.

This compiler is available in addition to the existing rule based compiler and Neo4j will automatically select which to use for each query (this behavior can be adjusted using compiler directives as described in the <a href=\"http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/query-tuning.html\">documentation of cypher query tuning</a>).\n- Full support for <a href=\"http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/how-do-i-profile-a-query.html\">profiling and explaining Cypher query plans</a>, including a query plan visualizer in the Neo4j Browser.\n- Username and password authentication for accessing Neo4j. <i>All access to the Neo4j Browser or REST APIs will now need to supply valid credentials.</i> For more detail, see the section on <a href=\"http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/security-server.html#security-server-auth\">server authentication and authorization in the documentation</a>.\n- A new page cache, which is faster, provides significant improvements in handling of concurrent operations, and is easier to configure than the memory mapping in previous Neo4j releases &mdash; now requiring only a single configuration setting (see <a href=\"http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/configuration-io-examples.html\">the configuration documentation</a> for details).\n- Introduces fast-write buffering which dramatically increases the throughput of many write workloads without any configuration required.\n- The use of separate transactions logs for the graph and the indexes, co-ordinated by an XA system, has been replaced by a singular transactional management and one unified transaction log. This substantially reduces resource overhead and improves scalability. Note that as result of this, the previously exposed XA and JTA functionalities have been removed.\n- Many, many fixes improving stability, performance and usability.\n\n**All Neo4j users are recommended to upgrade to this release**. <a href=\"http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/deployment-upgrading/\">Upgrading to Neo4j 2.2.0 requires a migration to the on-disk store</a> and can not be reversed.

Please ensure you have a valid backup before proceeding, then use on a test or staging server to understand any changed behaviors before going into production.\n\nNeo4j 1.9 users may upgrade directly to this release, and are recommended to do so carefully. We strongly encourage verifying the syntax and validating all responses from your Cypher scripts, REST calls, and Java code before upgrading any production system. For information about upgrading from Neo4j 1.9, please see our <a href=\"http://neo4j.com/upgrade-faq/\">Upgrading to Neo4j 2 FAQ</a>.\n"
