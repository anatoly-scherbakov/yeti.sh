Hi! My name is Anatoly Scherbakov, and this is my little personal site. See:

- A few random [articles](/articles/) that I've written,
- My [ongoing projects](/projects/),
- Unfinished [ideas](/ideas/),
- and [CV](/cv/).

## Why `yeti`?

I've lived in mountains of Siberia for quite a while. Cold, snow, mountains, forest, â€” who else would you expect to meet there indeed?
